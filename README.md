# Springboard Capstone Project

This project is my first attempt at learning R, Github, and Data Science in general. 
For this project, I chose to analyze crime in the city in which I live, Phoenix, AZ, to see what I could find. I plan on continuing to work on and add to this project for as long as I can. 

Through this project, I have learned how to gather and manipulate data in R, create visualizations using ggplot2, plotly, and Google Maps Static, as well as use version control, APIs, and numerous R libraries. 

I have also discovered some interesting statistics regarding crime in Phoenix, AZ. Please see my analysis report for a summary of my findings.
